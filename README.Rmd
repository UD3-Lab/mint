# mint

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Theses are relatively structured documents that are often
publicly available and thus potentially useful for text mining
applications. The 'mint' package provides a text mining workflow that
is tailored to the expected format and structure of theses. The
workflow covers extraction, pre-processing, analysis, visualisation
and reporting.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mint like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mint)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
