Description: Theses are relatively structured documents that are often
    publicly available and thus potentially useful for text mining
    applications. The 'mint' package provides a text mining workflow that
    is tailored to the expected format and structure of theses. The
    workflow covers extraction, pre-processing, analysis, visualisation
    and reporting.
